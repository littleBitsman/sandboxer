Remember that\\n  sandboxed code can still do something like `Instance1.Destroy(Instance2)`.\\n\\nImportant: The hook receives the *wrapped* proxy as its first variadic argument, not the raw `Instance`.\\nBecause `origFn` expects the raw instance as the first parameter, do **not** forward the wrapped\\nproxy directly.
